## Custom Leagues
With the Custom Leagues option, you can get game probabilities from any custom league. In order to do this, you must have a file named 'game_data.csv' in the same directory as the Python file, that contains data about all of the games. An example of the formatting has been provided in this folder. The Python script will read the CSV and compute the probabilities.

For the input data, only the home and visitor team names and scores are needed for each game. More columns may be included in the input CSV, but they will not be read by the program. The 4 required column headings must be spelled correctly.
